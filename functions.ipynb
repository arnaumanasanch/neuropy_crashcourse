    "Creating a new function gives you an opportunity to name a group of statements, which makes your program easier to read and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code. Later, if you make a change, you only have to make it in one place.\n",

    "\n",
    "One of the most important skills you will acquire is debugging. Although it can be frustrating, debugging is one of the most intellectually rich, challenging, and interesting parts of programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some ways debugging is like detective work. You are confronted with clues and you have to infer the processes and events that led to the results you see.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging is also like an experimental science. Once you have an idea about what is going wrong, you modify your program and try again. If your hypothesis was correct, you can predict the result of the modification, and you take a step closer to a working program. If your hypothesis was wrong, you have to come up with a new one. As Sherlock Holmes pointed out, “When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.” (A. Conan Doyle, The Sign of Four)\n",
    "\n",
    "For some people, programming and debugging are the same thing. That is, programming is the process of gradually debugging a program until it does what you want. The idea is that you should start with a working program and make small modifications, debugging them as you go."
