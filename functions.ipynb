    "As you write larger functions, you might find yourself spending more time debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "To deal with increasingly complex programs, you might want to try a process called incremental development. The goal of incremental development is to avoid long debugging sessions by adding and testing only a small amount of code at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, suppose you want to find the distance between two points, given by the coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). By the Pythagorean theorem, the distance is:\n",
    "distance = \t√\t\n",
    "(x2 − x1)2 + (y2 − y1)2\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to consider what a distance function should look like in Python. In other words, what are the inputs (parameters) and what is the output (return value)?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the inputs are two points, which you can represent using four numbers. The return value is the distance represented by a floating-point value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Immediately you can write an outline of the function:\n",
    "\n",
    "def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n",
    "    return 0.0\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, this version doesn’t compute distances; it always returns zero. But it is syntactically correct, and it runs, which means that you can test it before you make it more complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test the new function, call it with sample arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> distance(1, 2, 4, 6)\n",
    "0.0\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose these values so that the horizontal distance is 3 and the vertical distance is 4; that way, the result is 5, the hypotenuse of a 3-4-5 triangle. When testing a function, it is useful to know the right answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point we have confirmed that the function is syntactically correct, and we can start adding code to the body. A reasonable next step is to find the differences x2 − x1 and y2 − y1. The next version stores those values in temporary variables and prints them.\n",
    "\n",
    "def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n",
    "    dx = x2 - x1\n",
    "    dy = y2 - y1\n",
    "    print('dx is', dx)\n",
    "    print('dy is', dy)\n",
    "    return 0.0\n",
    "\n",
    "If the function is working, it should display dx is 3 and dy is 4. If so, we know that the function is getting the right arguments and performing the first computation correctly. If not, there are only a few lines to check.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we compute the sum of squares of dx and dy:\n",
    "\n",
    "def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n",
    "    dx = x2 - x1\n",

    "    print('dsquared is: ', dsquared)\n",
    "    return 0.0\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, you would run the program at this stage and check the output (which should be 25). Finally, you can use math.sqrt to compute and return the result:\n",
    "\n",
    "def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n",
    "    dx = x2 - x1\n",
    "    dy = y2 - y1\n",
    "    dsquared = dx**2 + dy**2\n",
    "    result = math.sqrt(dsquared)\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "\n",
    "If that works correctly, you are done. Otherwise, you might want to print the value of result before the return statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final version of the function doesn’t display anything when it runs; it only returns a value. The print statements we wrote are useful for debugging, but once you get the function working, you should remove them. Code like that is called scaffolding because it is helpful for building the program but is not part of the final product.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you start out, you should add only a line or two of code at a time. As you gain more experience, you might find yourself writing and debugging bigger chunks. Either way, incremental development can save you a lot of debugging time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key aspects of the process are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Start with a working program and make small incremental changes. At any point, if there is an error, you should have a good idea where it is.\n",
    "    Use variables to hold intermediate values so you can display and check them.\n",
    "    Once the program is working, you might want to remove some of the scaffolding or consolidate multiple statements into compound expressions, but only if it does not make the program difficult to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an exercise, use incremental development to write a function called hypotenuse that returns the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the lengths of the other two legs as arguments. Record each stage of the development process as you go.\n",
    "6.3  Composition\n",
    "\n",
    "As you should expect by now, you can call one function from within another. As an example, we’ll write a function that takes two points, the center of the circle and a point on the perimeter, and computes the area of the circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that the center point is stored in the variables xc and yc, and the perimeter point is in xp and yp. The first step is to find the radius of the circle, which is the distance between the two points. We just wrote a function, distance, that does that:\n",
    "\n",
    "radius = distance(xc, yc, xp, yp)\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to find the area of a circle with that radius; we just wrote that, too:\n",
    "\n",
    "result = area(radius)\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulating these steps in a function, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "def circle_area(xc, yc, xp, yp):\n",
    "    radius = distance(xc, yc, xp, yp)\n",
    "    result = area(radius)\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "\n",
    "The temporary variables radius and result are useful for development and debugging, but once the program is working, we can make it more concise by composing the function calls:\n",
    "\n",

    "    return area(distance(xc, yc, xp, yp))\n",
    "\n",
    "6.4  Boolean functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can return booleans, which is often convenient for hiding complicated tests inside functions. For example:\n",

    "    if x % y == 0:\n",
    "        return True\n",

Any program ever written could be rewritten using only the language features you have learned so far (actually, you would need a few commands to control devices like the mouse, disks, etc., but that’s all).\n",

    "Following the flow of execution is one way to read programs, but it can quickly become overwhelming. An alternative is what I call the “leap of faith”.

    "\n",
    "The same is true when you call one of your own functions. For example, in Section 6.4, we wrote a function called is_divisible that determines whether one number is divisible by another. Once we have convinced ourselves that this function is correct—by examining the code and testing—we can use the function without looking at the body again.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same is true of recursive programs. When you get to the recursive call, instead of following the flow of execution, you should assume that the recursive call works (returns the correct result) and then ask yourself, “Assuming that I can find the factorial of n−1, can I compute the factorial of n?” It is clear that you can, by multiplying by n.\n",

    "\n",
    "If the parameters look good, add a print statement before each return statement and display the return value. If possible, check the result by hand. Consider calling the function with values that make it easy to check the result (as in Section 6.2).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the function seems to be working, look at the function call to make sure the return value is being used correctly (or used at all!).\n",
