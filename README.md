# README #

Repository for a programming crash course in Python for biologists and psychologists at the Cortical Networks Lab, IDIBAPS.

## Instructors:

* Arnau Manasanch
* [Andrea Insabato](https://andreainsabato.eu)

## Credits:

This course is mainly based upon the excellent book "How to think like a computer scientist" by Allen Downey, freely downloadable from here: https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/

We omitted some sections and summarized others in order to adjust the contents to the expected audience. We also included some additional contents that are usually needed for the analysis of neuroscience data (mainly numpy, matplotlib, pandas).

All errors and confusions are most probably due to our alterations of the original book.
